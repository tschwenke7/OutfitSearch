# Outfit Search
Sick of wasting time in the morning trying to choose something to wear? Can't remember what worked well together in the past? Outfit Search is the solution!

Using this app, you can save photos of each outfit you wear, along with its season, formality and a list of the clothing items that make it up. You can then scroll through and easily browse your previous outfits, search for outfits with specific items or types of item (e.g. colour, 'pants') or you can hit the "choose for me" button if you really can't decide.

## Installation
To install Outfit Search on your Android device, download the file "OutfitSearch_<version>.apk" in the root directory of this repo to your device and open it (see here for guide: https://www.nextpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file#howtofromandroid).

## Searching for outfits
### Adding a new outfit
To add a new outfit, simply tap the "+" icon in the top right corner of the screen. See "Creating an outfit" section below for more details.

### Browsing outfits
The main screen of the app will show a list of all of your outfits, with the photo and list of components. You can scroll through them, and click on one to see it in more detail/edit it. You can also swipe an outfit to the side, which will send it to the back of the list of all your outfits. You could use this to hide outfits you've worn recently or don't feel like wearing today.

### Filtering outfits
You can filter the list of outfits by season or formality by using the drop down selectors under the search bar.

### Searching for outfits
The search bar allows you to enter search queries to further filter the list of outfits. Typing here will show only outfits which have clothing items with names that contain your search. You could use this to search for outfits containing a specific item (existing clothing items will be suggested by autocomplete as you type). You could also search for something more broad, like "skirt" or "blue". This will show outfits which have a skirt, or have an item with "blue" in the name. NOTE: the effectiveness of these broader searches depends on the way you name your items. Try to include useful features like the colour/s and type of item when naming them so you can search by these later.

You can also search for outfits matching multiple criteria by separating queries with a comma, e.g.

"Navy blue denim jacket, skirt"

This search will show outfits which contain your navy blue denim jacket, and ALSO have an item with "skirt" in the name.

### Finding other outfits using an item
When viewing an outfit, you can double click on an item from the list of clothing items to show other outfits using this same item.

## Creating an outfit
## Adding a photo
The most important part of your outfit entry is the photo. You can either add a photo from your phone's gallery, or take a photo in the app. The photo will be stored on your device (compressed to save space, average size is ~800KB per photo).

## Adding clothing items
You also need to enter the names of each of the clothing items that make up your outfit. When naming a clothing item in an outfit, make sure to give it a name which uniquely identifies it in your wardrobe. If you're adding an item which has already been added in a previous outfit, make sure to give it the same name. Existing items should come up as autocomplete options as you type.

We also suggest naming in a way that contains useful information about the item.

e.g. "Navy blue denim jacket"

Now this will match searches not just for the specific item, but also for search keywords such as "Blue", "navy", "jacket" or "denim". Using descriptive names can greatly enhance the searching power you have over your outfits!

## Renaming a clothing item
If you later decide you want to change the name of a clothing item, click on an outfit containing it to return to this view/edit page. You can then tap and hold the name of the item and it will become editable. NOTE: changing the name in one outfit will also change it in any other outfits containing an item with the same name.

## Setting season and formality
Drop down selectors below the outfit photo will allow you to set the "Season" (e.g. 'summer', 'winter') and "Formality" (e.g. casual, work, formal etc.). You can add a new season or formality option by selecting the "Add new" option in the drop down menu. There's no limit to the number of options you can add. Existing options will be selectable from the drop down already. These categories will allow you to filter your outfit list, so think about what categories will be most helpful to you.
